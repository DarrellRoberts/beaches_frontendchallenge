## Glam Up My Markup: Beaches

This was an entry to Dev's Frontend Challenge v24.05.29.

The brief is here: https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-05-29

In essence the goal was to add style and functionality to a html page without modifying it.

I choose to include a map and used CSS grid to pinpoint where the beaches were located on this background.

For the JavaScript, I used DOM manipulation to break up the html page into two sections, and added click event listeners to each beach list item, in order to conceal the beach details. This makes the page a lot more digestible as the user can explore by themselves which beach they would like to know more about.

Cheers,
Darrell
